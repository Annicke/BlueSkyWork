GitHub is a Web based code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.
GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects. A GitHub repository can also be used to store ideas, or any resources that you want to share.



From your VISUAL STUDIO, while you are are working on your project, you can go to:
	* Tools
	* Extension And Update
	* By default you are on installed
	* CLick on 'online'
	* Search for Github Desktop and 
	* Click on Install.
	* IT requires that you reopen your Visual Studio.
	* Accept the modification proposed

On your Github account open the Repository

On the right side of Visual Studio, there are some 0ptions one of the is Github and then connect. So choose connect. A window pop up and you input your credential only if you have already an account on Github; if not go ahead and create and account.

On the right side of Visual Studio, on Github still,
	* click on Create
		- Give the name of your project
		-Descriptions
		-Your Local path
		-Click on Create

On your Github account, click on refresh to refresh you repository, once you have done that, the number of you repository swithes, you can see the name of you new repository appearing.

Back on Visual Studio, let go to 'Team Explorer'
Under the solution,
	* click on 'New'
	* Give name on that New Solution(the project)
From the solution Explorer, go on Team Explorer and start making some changes:
	- Take a look at Changes, if we open changes we will now see all the work done on that particular project. This indicate that the repository has been created and now ready to be pushed.
	- Enter a commit message. At GitHub, changes are called commits.
		* Initial Commint
	- You have different options on Commit:
Each commit (change) has a description explaining why a change was made.
		*Commit ALl
		*Commit All and Push
		*Commit All and Sync.

Commit All simple means commit into the local repository
Commit All and Push means commit into the local repository and push into the Github.com repository(Because thete is 2 different repository, the local Github repository and the Central Github repository).
Commit All and Sync means Commit in to the Github local and the central repository and also pull all the changes that may have happen since the last time.

	- Lets click on Commit All and Sync, and futher click on Yes on that new window.

Go back to Github account and refresh the 2nd commit apprear in meaning that that you have Synchronised your commit successfully.
